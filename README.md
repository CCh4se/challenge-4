##  Challenge -4 

## Coding Quiz 


# Description
For this project we were tasked with taking what we learned in class about web api and javascript and apply it into making a multiple choice quiz. This was done by having a timer and a score being recorded at the end of the quiz. Then allowing the quiz to be saved in the local storage and displayed as a leaderboard for all the attempts. For myself I didn't get close to how I would have like to submit as an assignment, but I plan on resubmitting and making it a polished website.

For myself I found a lot of my answer through our prior work in class, but also finding quite a bit of knowledge on the subject with www.w3schools.com and www.developer.mozilla.org. Unfortunately I didn't have enough this time to meet with a tutor this week as well.
